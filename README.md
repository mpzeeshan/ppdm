Fuzzy Based Random Perturbation For Real World Bank Datasets 

Privacy preservation is the major concern while real time datasets are handled. Privacy preserving data mining (PPDM), deals with data modification and also limits information loss. Data perturbation is one of the PPDM techniques which deals with numerical data and focuses on maintaining statistical properties of data. There are two types of perturbation, additive perturbation and multiplicative perturbation, where generated random value is either added or multiplied to the data, which results in a modified data.

The idea of using fuzzy logic is applied to preserve the individual information while revealing the details in public. This project mainly focuses on converting the sensitive data into modified data by using Triangular fuzzy membership function.

In this project, a fuzzy methodology is considered for selection of customers whom the bank should target for deposit subscription. Fuzzy set theory aims at modelling imprecise and ambiguous information. Computers cannot still effectively handle such scenarios as general machine intelligence systems employ sequential (Boolean) logic. The human brain is exceptional and superior as it has the capacity to handle fuzzy statements and decisions. It works by filtering and selecting data that is relevant and has purpose.
